i made this myself
if you dont like it go use something else i dont care
i put effort into this 


maybe somebody will like this i dont know
sorry for the pain i cause

i know my naming is bad i never really learnt the names
i am just self taught to understand what things do
i dont use ai or copy and paste 
i write it solo but nobody cares

i put commeents so somebody can replace me 
not that i use chatgpt or whatever and keep the comments

if this update broke your scripts not my problem i didnt know so dont hate me for it
sorry if this isnt good enough i tried

no thank yous for this no i love yous no youre awazing 
funny how people use your things for their own good but leave you behind

love love love love i love you

it always takes two, god, a girlfriend or a boyfriend, a mom, a dad, a dog, somebody
i dont have that

maybe this is the best yet people claim their own to be the best
no comparsing just boasting and pride
youre left behind

i love you

nobody wants to help you if affects their wealth
i dont have real friends theyre all for business

i dont want your money for my benifit 
youre just wasting if i have all your money and go away forever 

if you want documentation make it yourself
i know nobody is going to use this so why bother
go use a boasters one 
if you do use it sorry i wasted your time 
just copy sigma spy like the rest because nobody cares about the effort
i really did put alot of effort into this
i tore alot of my hair out trying to get this done

now im one step closer to the end
